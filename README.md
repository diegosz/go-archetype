*Dead simple project blueprints for the rest of us.*

*go-archetype* is a tool for creating project blueprints (aka archetypes) in your native language.

If you or your company create new projects and you want all these projects to preserve a similar structure or simply create a good starting point for other develoeprs, use go-archetype to define project archtypes (templates).

## Concept

Typically two roles are involved:

* The **archetype creator** (typically a senior developer/architect)
* The **developer** creating a new project

### The archetype creator

As the archetype creator you create a template (aka blueprint) project. This project is fully functional, valid code written in your native language, be it Golang, JavaScript, Java, Python etc. (go-archetype is written in golang but can be used to generate tempaltes in any language)
Then you define a set of transformations. E.g. ask the user for the project name and replace here, here and here.

What you don't need to do is: Create a bluprint in a meta-language. Other templating tools, such as the python cookiecutter require you to write your blueprint (template) project in a meta-language, e.g. cookiecutter's language. With go-archetype you don't have to do that; your write your tempalte in your native language and then define a simple set of transformations for generating templates.

### Developer using the archetype

As a developer creating a new project based on the archetype, you run `go-archetype` with a few parameters, you answer a few questions (defined by the template creator such as what is your new project's name, these questions are defined by the archetype creator) and your new code is generated.

### Summary

Here are the steps:

1. Architect creates an actual working project. This project is used as a blueprint or an archetype. It's a barebones project, no templating involved.
1. Architect defines a set of transformations in transformations.yml. These transformations are used for simple search-and-replace in the blueprint. (and there are more compicated types, see below)
1. Developer runs go-archetype to create a new project based on the blueprint.

### Example project
Example project using go-archetype: https://github.com/rantav/go-template


## Usage

    go-archetype transform --transformations=transformations.yml --source=. --destination=/path/to/your/new/project

## The transformations.yml file

The transformations file contains two main sections:

* **inputs**
* and **transformations**

The *inputs* section defines user inputs, see description below.
The *transformations* section defines the list of ordered transformations as explained below.

See the file transformations.yml in this very project as an example.

## Requesting for user input

It is common to request user inputs in order to apply a set of transformations. For example you might want to request for the project name, description, whether to include this or that functionality.

There are following types of input: `text`, `yesno` and `select`. 
- `text` provides simple, single-line text inputs. 
- `yesno` originates a boolean [y/N] question.
- `select` allows to select from a list of predefined options.

Example:

```yml
inputs:
  - id: ProjectName
    text: What is the project name?
    type: text
  - id: IncludeReadme
    text: Would you like to include the readme file?
    type: yesno
  - id: ProjectType
    text: Select example type
    type: select
    options:
      - simple
      - advanced    
```

The `id` must be unique and is later also used for performing the transformations (see below).

A user may provide the required inputs interactively when promped to when running go-archetype.

Likewise, The user may also provide the input as CLI arguments, which is useful for automation. (see example below)

Interactive question example: (what the user sees while running go-archetype)

    ? Would you like to include the readme file? (y/N)

And when providing the input as CLI args:

```sh
go-archetype transform --transformations=transformations.yml \
    --source=. \
    --destination=.tmp/go/my-go-project \
    -- \
    --ProjectName my-go-project \
    --IncludeReadme yes \
    --ProjectType simple 
```

In this example there are following inputs: `ProjectName`, `IncludeReadme` and `ProjectType`.

To seperate program args from user input we use `--`. After the `--` the list of user inputs is provided.

## Templating user input

After accepting user input you might want to transform and tempalte it.

We use go templates as a templatting languate. For the full overview of the templating language see [text/template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)
Following is a list of several examples to get you started.

* User inputs are wrapped in `{{` and `}}`
* User inputs are prepended with `.`, so for example `{{.ProjectName}}` would yield the user's provided project name.
* You may combine user input with constats, for example `{{.ProjectName}} - {{.ProjectDescription}}`, which concatenates the project's name with a hyphen and then it's description.

Pipelines and functions are a useful concept. For example you might request the project's name and then display this project name  in uppercase in the readme file and lowercase in source files. To that end we provide a host of **template pipelines**.

    {{ .ProjectName | upper }} # ProjectName is provided by the user and we transform it to all uppercase. with the upper pipeline
    {{ wrap 80 .Description }} # Wordwrap the project description by 80 characters

We include out the the box the [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/strings.html) library, which includes many differnet string manipulation functions, to list a few: `trim`, `trimAll`, `trimSuffix`, `trimPrefix`, `upper`, `lower`, `title`, `wrap`, `plural`, `snakecase`, `camelcase`, `kebabcase` etc.

## Transformers

There are two types of transformers: the **include** and **replace** transformers.

### The *include* transformer

The include transformer allows inclusion or exclusion of whole files as well as parts of files in the generated project. A simple example: you ask then user whether to include a README file and based on the answer you include or exlude this entire file.

#### Including or exluding whole files

All files that pass the global ignore filter are included by default. Unless one or more of the *include* rules with an empty `region_marker` applies to them, in which case the files are included only if the condition evaluates to true.

Condition is a go template condition as can be used in an `{{if}}` expression. As such a simple boolean is expressed as simply `.var` where `var` is typically a user input.

For example with the following user input:

```yml
inputs:
  - id: IncludeReadme
    text: Would you like to include the readme file?
    type: yesno
```

It is possbible to define the following include transformer:

```yml
transformations:
  - name: include the readme file
    type: include
    region_marker: # When there's no marker, the entire file(s) is included
    condition: .IncludeReadme
    files: ["README.md"]
```

Note that when there's no `region_marker` that simply means that the entire file is included/excluded based on the user's input.

More sophisticated expresions could also be utilized, such as boolean algebra, using `and .x .y`, `or .x .y` etc (`x` and `y` are user inputs). For a complete reference, see [go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).

#### Don't forget the dot `.`

Keep in mind that go templates require a dot (`.`) to prepend a value. So when utilizing user input, for example such as `IncludeReadme` be sure to prepend the dot, e.g. `.IncludeReadme` whenever used in conditions or replacements.

One caveat to that is that for simplicity go-archetype allows dot-less conditions when they are very simple, e.g. only `variable`, such as `IncludeReadme`. So the following conditions are actually equivalent:

```
condition: .IncludeReadme
```

and

```
condition: IncludeReadme # No dot here
```

This is done in order to simplify the simple single-operand conditions. However, with more complex conditions be sure to prepend the dot.
For example the following condition is valid where x and y are user inputs:

```
condition: and .x .y
```

But the following is not valid:

```
condition: and x y # Not valid. x and y need to be prepended by a dot .
```

#### Including or exluding parts of files

Sometimes it's useful to conditionally include or exlude parts of files and not the entire files. To do this we utilize special region markers.

Example:

```go
import (
	"net"
	"net/http"

	"golang.org/x/sync/errgroup"

	// BEGIN __INCLUDE_GRPC__
	channelz "github.com/rantav/go-grpc-channelz"
	channelzservice "google.golang.org/grpc/channelz/service"
	// END __INCLUDE_GRPC__
)
```

The includes `channelz` and `channelzservice` are only required in cases where the user selected to add gRPC functionality to the project.

The corresponding transformations.yml file sections are:

```yml
inputs:
  - id: include_grpc
    text: Should gRPC functionality be included?
    type: yesno

transformations:
  - name: "include grpc - parts of files"
    type: include
    region_marker: __INCLUDE_GRPC__
    condition: .include_grpc
    files: ["Makefile", "**/*.go", "deployments/*"] # optional, just as an example
```

To summarize, in cases where you'd like to include or exlude just parts of files (and not the entire file), you use special *region markers* inside the source code file. These region markers are simply comments in Go or in Java, PHP etc.

### The *replace* transformer

This transformer performs a search and replace functionality. For example, you might ask the user for the project name and then replace the generic template project name with the user's provided name

Example:

```yml
inputs:
  - id: name
    text: What is the project name? (e.g. my-awesome-go-project)
    type: text

transformations:
  - name: project name
    type: replace # The type of the transformer is **replace**
    pattern: go-template # The text pattern to search and replace
    replacement: "{{ .name }}" # The text to replace. You may use go tempalates and perform arbitrary replacements.
    files: ["*.go", "**/*.go", "**/*.sh", ".gitignore", "README.md"]
```

### The *rename* transformer

This transformer renames files. For example, you might want to rename all the files with the pattern `<go-template>` with the user's provided project name.

Example:

Let's imagine, you have a project template with the following structure:

```
go-template
├── cmd
│  └── go-template
│     ├── go-template.go
│     └── main.go
├── Dockerfile
└── README.md
```

And the following `transformations.yml` file:

```yml
inputs:
  - id: name
    text: What is the project name? (e.g. my-awesome-go-project)
    type: text

transformations:
  - name: rename files to the project name
    type: rename # The type of the transformer is **rename**
    pattern: go-template # The text pattern to search and replace
    replacement: "{{ .name }}" # The text to replace. You may use go tempalates and perform arbitrary replacements.
    files: ["**"]
```

Then, after transformations you will get a new project with the renamed files like these:

```
my-awesome-go-project
├── cmd
│  └── my-awesome-go-project
│     ├── my-awesome-go-project.go
│     └── main.go
├── Dockerfile
└── README.md
```

### Recepies

A list of useful recepies.

#### Always ignore

To always exclude some parts of the output regardless of user input, do as follows:

```yml
transformers:
  - name: do not include template code in the final output
    type: include
    region_marker: __DO_NOT_INCLUDE__
    condition: false
    files: ["**"]
```

And then in your source file(s):

```
# BEGIN __DO_NOT_INCLUDE__
... Code that should neven be included in the final output, such as
... templating specific scripts, makefiles etc
# END __DO_NOT_INCLUDE__
```

#### Conditional replace

Sometimes you need to conditionally replace a pattern. The condition may depend on user input. For example you may ask the user whether they'd like to includ gRPC functionality in the project or not and based on that render a different makefile.

Since the underlying rendering engine uses [go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) it is possible to utilize the following condition:

```
{{ if .include_grpc }}build: build-grpc{{ else }}build:{{end}}
```

This condition will render `build:` if `.include_grpc` is false and `build: build-grpc` if `.include_grpc` is true. `include_grpc` is a user input in this case.

The complete example would look as follows then:

```yml
inputs:
  - id: include_grpc
    text: Should gRPC functionality be included?
    type: yesno
transformations:
  - name: build with grpc or not
    type: replace
    pattern: "build: build-grpc"
    replacement: "{{ if .include_grpc }}build: build-grpc{{ else }}build:{{end}}"
    files: ["Makefile"]
```

#### Change to CamelCase

If you have a string that you'd like to change to CamelCase, for example `my-project`, first convert to snake_case and then to CamelCase. This is unfortunately a limitation of sprig.

Example:

```
replacement: "{{ .name | snakecase | camelcase }}"
```

Changing to camelCase where the first letter is lowercased is even more ticky, but here goes:

```
replacement: "{{ .name | snakecase | camelcase | swapcase | title | swapcase }}"
```

Yeah it works...

#### Inclusion By Selection
Select allows to select one of the options and include section depends on selected choice.

```yml
  - name: simple
    type: include
    region_marker: __ProjectType_SIMPLE__
    condition: "eq .ProjectType \"simple\""
    files: ["main.go"]
  - name: medium
    type: include
    region_marker: __ProjectType_MEDIUM__
    condition: "eq .ProjectType \"medium\""
    files: ["main.go"]
  - name: advanced
    type: include
    region_marker: __ProjectType_ADVANCED__
    condition: "eq .ProjectType \"advanced\""
    files: ["main.go"]
```

## Order of execution

Transformatinos are executed by the order they appear inside the transformations.yml file. The output of the first transformation is then piped into the input of the second transformation and so forth.
That means that the order is important such that if you're pattern needs to match certain text, you need to make sure that no previous transformation had changed this text. That's why it's wise to start with the more specific replacements and then move on to the more generic replacements.

Example:

```yml
transformations:
  - name: project long description
    type: replace
    pattern: Use go-archetype to transform project archetypes into existing live projects
    replacement: "{{ wrap 80 .ProjectDescription }}"
    files: ["cmd/root.go"]
  - name: project name
    type: replace
    pattern: go-archetype
    replacement: "{{ .ProjectName }}"
    files: ["*.go", "**/*.go"]
```

`project long description` should be placed before `project name`. If it weren't so then after applying ProjetName replacement on all occurences of the string `"go-archetype"` then the sentence `"Use go-archetype to transform project archetypes into existing live projects"` would have become `"Use my-project-name to transform project archetypes into existing live projects"` and then the replacement would not have been matched.

## Before and After

The `before` and `after` hooks allow you to run arbitrary shell command just before running all transformations or just after then.

They are provided with useful context that can be used in the actual command, which includes:

* `source` (Used as `{{ .source }}`)
* `destination` (Used as `{{ .destination }}`)
* As well as all user inputs

Example:

```yaml
after:
  operations:
    - sh:
      # You can define commands with the basic syntax.
      # If so, each command will be separated by the <newline> symbol. Each line will be executed
      # separately.
      - cd {{.destination}} && echo $PWD
      # Either, you can use the extended syntax.
      # cmd defines command line to be executed.
      - cmd: echo Done archetyping from {{ .source }} to {{ .destination }} of project {{ .ProjectName }}
        # if multiline is set to false, then it runs exactly as basic syntax command
        multiline: false
      # Or, you can set multiline to true. Then, the command will be executed as-is.
      # To make this happen, use YAML multiline operator "|".
      # See also: https://yaml-multiline.info/
      - cmd: |
          if [ 1 == 1 ]; then
            echo "OK!"
          fi
        multiline: true
```
